  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>This is where I'll put all my Tech Tuesday essays (Please note most of these will be rather shit, to put it crudely, I think I'd sooner die than write a 500 (Now 250, thank god) word essay every single Tuesday). In all honesty, who actually likes writing essays? Stretching something that can be explained in a few sentences into a 250-750 word monster. Changing it's to it is, and we're to we are. Anyone? Yeah I don't think so. I would find it easier to write an essay on how much I hate essays. In any event, I get that school is supposed to teach you things, at the price of being miserable, but I don't understand how this teaches you anything.  Who cares about a random tech article some kid wrote, based on a tech article that already exists, and is probably much better and informing. Seriously, just go read the original article. Anyway, enjoy (Or don't, I sure as hell didn't).</p>

    <h1>Essay 1</h1
    <p1><i>X (Twitter), has added a new feature to its reply control menu, allowing the poster to limit the ability to reply to "verified" users. Previously users could limit replies only to mentioned accounts and accounts they follow, or simply allow everyone to reply to the post. In fact, before 2021, users could not even control this at all. Elon Musk, CTO and owner of X, has commented that this feature is to reduce messages from spam bots. I would not be informed enough to comment on weather or not spam bots are a serious problem for most users, since I don't use X (Or any social media, for that matter), though I'm sure they wouldn't waste time and money making a feature that nobody needs (Probably). There are those who have debated weather or not this feature will be as useful as Musk says it will be, as there have been instances of verified accounts spreading false information and spamming, on rare (but not non-existant) occasions. Personally, I think those instances can be chalked up to a user being missinformed themselves, and genuinely believing the information to be true, despite the falsehood. Although it is very true that some people are just out to see the world go up in flames, I think that many cases of the spreading of false information can be attributed to victims of missinformation passing on the article or piece of false media to other people. Maybe they found it interesting and decided to spread around this facinating article, and people just blamed them for doing it deliberately once it was discovered that the article was made up of false information. In summary, X has a new feature that should hopefully help with the problem of spam botting X posts, but also maybe not. (See, explained in one sentence, essays suck)</i> </p1>

    <h1>Essay 2 (Here we go again)</h1>
    <p1><i>Recent figures have shown that crypto currency has been used more and more for scams online, more than any other method, the median individual reported loss being around $2,600. Nearly 1 of every 4 dollars reported to be lost were lost in the form of crypto currency. This is to be expected, as crypto currency scams have several features that make them easier for scammers than other forms of payment from the victims. First, there isn't a central authority to stop these transactions. With nobody to warn victims of these scams, it's significantly easier to get away with it. Secondly, once a transaction is made, it often can't be reversed, meaning once the scam has been pulled off, the victims likely won't be able to get their money back. Finally, and probably the biggest factor of all, many people are still very unfamilier with how crypto currency works, making them much more vulnerable to scams using this payment type. Additionally, it's shown that people in their 30's are the most at risk of these scams, with people from the ages 20-49 were three times more likely to be a victim of these scams then any other age group. Also, 35% of money reported lost to scams by people in their 30's was paid in crypto currency. Please note, all above information is accurate as of June 2022 (The article I found was rather outdated, and I didn't feel like looking for another one).</i></p1>

    <h1>Essay 3</h1>
    <p1><i>I feel like if I'm going to be making more essays on blackchain, I should explain what it is first. Blockchain is a digital storage that stores data, whether that be cryptocurrency payments or NFT records. Blockchain is named for the "blocks" of data in a "chain". Blockchain is totally decentralized, in that it doesn't have a central bank or record of the chain, but instead copies of the chain are spread across multiple computers, called nodes. Since all nodes must have identical records, they all confirm each new bit of dada as it's added, making blockchain a highly secure way to store information. A single centralized system can be troubled by a single person making a mistake, and thus messing up the whole record without knowing. Blockchain can also be used for DeFi (Decentralized finance), storing contracts. When a node verifies data and sends it through to the chain, it is rewarded with a certain amount of the blockchains native currency. The most common use of blockchain is to log cryptocurrency transactions, such as Bitcoin. Blockchain is not without disadvantages, such as higher energy use, and lower transactions per second when logging currency payments or transfers. You can also have the data in your chain leaked if an attacker gets hold of your passkey (If the chain is so guarded). Finally, since blockchain is so secretive and secure, it is very appealing to criminals, making their illegal transactions harder to track.</i></p1>

    <h1>Essay 4</h1>
    <p1><i>According to one study, roughly a third of businesses believe that artificial intelligence will be one of the most dangerous cyber security threats in the coming years. ChatGPT being accessable by literally anybody, as well as being able to write code for you, for completely free no less, is believed by some to be able to write extremely advanced malware for attackers. Many are also worried about the very small reserve of individuals with the skills to combat AI based malware. The vice president of technology at Fastly, Sean Leach, states that AI will be used as a tool to assist in the creation of simple code, but won't be used as a way to make "super malware" for a while yet. Businesses are also concerned about their data being leaked by AI, or for AI, in the case of data being used as training data for machine learning models without the consent of the owner of the data. Some say that this could result in the data being revealed to the world through the use of the model. On the other hand, AI could also be used to significantly reduce the amount of work a single human security worker has to do, possibly tightening security around these companies data. One of the reasons many junior security staff don't stay there very long is the amount of tedious and repetitive work they have to do. In summary, as far as cyber security goes, businesses will have a lot more ground to cover in terms of protecting their data from leaks and AI based attacks. However they now also have a variety of AI based tools to assist them in combating such threats.</i></p1>

    <h1>Essay 5</h1>
    <p1><i>What is bullying? Bullying is repeated abuse in a physical, phycological, or relational manner. Bullying can lead to a variety of harmful consequences to both the bully and bullied, such as a higher likelyhood of developing a mental illnesses in the future. Bullies are often abused or mistreated at home, and sometimes need the same help a victim of bullying might. They may simply want to get out their anger or negative feelings on other individuals. Sometimes they may bully because they are being bullied themselves. There are many ways to deal with being bullied, though there is no real correct or foolproof way to stop the bullying. You can try to laugh off insults or go to a teacher, but a generally good thing to do is to show the bully they can't control you or your emotions. Above all don't let the words bother you, and instead focus on the brighter sides of your life. Hang out with friends so as to not be alone. Always report the bully to a trusted adult, openly or privately.</i></p1>

    <h1>Essay 6</h1>
    <p1><i>Across the world, countries are working towards a more digitalized economy. Simultaniously, more and more jobs involving manual labor are being replaced by machines. This closes off those jobs but also opens new ones. Every machine still requires code to operate, and humans to write that code. Coding is rapidly becoming one of the single most important skills in the modern world in many countries. Children should be able to keep up in this rapidly evolving world. Studies have even shown that learning programming at a young age is beneficial to children, no matter their desired career pathway. Coding has been shown to increase creativity and problem solving skills in children.</i></p1>

    <h1>Essay 7</h1>
    <p1><i>The United Kingdom has recently begun a project to build 277 offshore wind turbines in Dogger Bank, 70 nautical miles off the coast of Yorkshire. The project was put into motion by the UKs SSE and Norways Equinor and Vårgrønn. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is heavily supportive of the project, seeking to make climate protection a key plank of his political platform. He recieved criticism from climate change activists, believing he wasn't working towards net zero emissions hard enough. The grid, if it is finished, will be complete in 2026. This speed would be impressive for the amount of power being produced. The grid would harness 3.6 gigawatts, powering around six million homes in the United Kingdom. Developers of the project say that for every rotation of just one of the three blades on the first turbine can power an average British home for two days. The project will cost an estimated nine billion pounds when completed. Several other companies in other countries have ceased work on similar projects simply because it was no longer profitable. The British prime minister, however, is determined to finish the project, saying it would "not only bolster our energy security but create jobs, lower electricity bills and keep us on track for net zero".</i></p1>
