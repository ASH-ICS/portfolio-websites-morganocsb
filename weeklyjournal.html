  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>This is kind of like a diary I guess, written on Fridays (Fri-Js) and summarizing the week in a few sentences.</p>
  <a href="index.html"> Go Back </a>

  <article>
    <h1>Week One:</h1
    <p1><i>On the first week of school, we watched a movie called Hidden Figures. It was about black women working at NASA in 1961, and I found it pretty interesting.</i> </p1>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h1>Week Two:</h1>
    <p1><i>Week two we learned about binary, converting it to and from decimal numbers, and adding and subtracting it. We also learned about logic gates. </i> </p1>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h1>Week Three:</h1>
    <p1><i>During week three we started on our first class project, making posters about a variety of hardware and software. Myself and Mac chose malware as our subject. We ended up making it online and printing it out right at the last second, since Mac was absent for a bit and I had no idea we had to actually go out and buy a board. As long as we don't get a zero I'm happy. (No idea what happened but we just stopped working on it for some reason, not sure why)</i> </p1>
  </article>

   <article>
    <h1>Week Four:</h1>
    <p1><i>Week four was kind of just a normal week, we worked on portfolios and something called CMU, which I finished pretty quickly and easily. We did a project with it at the end of the week for the national day of truth and reconciliation. Other than that a fairly basic week, nothing new but CMU.</i> </p1>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h1>Week Five:</h1>
    <p1><i>It's been revealed that on every Tuesday we have to write a 500 word essay on some random ass tech topic. Complete waste of time obviously, but whatever. My pathetic attempts at essays can be found in the Essays page, if you care to have a laugh. On the bright side, I've signed up for the 9-12 D&D club, hoping it won't be trash. Most of your typical school D&D clubs are DM'd by kids who have never played Dungeons and Dragons before and have no idea how to run a campaign, and fall apart after a couple sessions. Rather sad, but if neccessary I can run DM for the group. I sure as hell know what I'm doing when it comes to running a campaign, though I'd hoped to be able to play in this one instead. That was part of the reason I didn't join the D&D group for the 7-8s, where the high schoolers could only be DMs. Also because my brother was in that one and I despise my brother. In summary, this class is going to be awful on Tuesdays. Definitely looking forward to the Thanksgiving 4 day long weekend. Though I'll probably have to go somewhere with my family, which I'm definitely NOT Looking forward to. Might go to the cottage, hopefully not. If I do, at the very least I'll be able to see my cousins, even if it is a complete waste of a perfectly good long weekend. I rarely have positive experiences over Thanksgiving weekend, but I should have something to hope for. Besides all that, it's shaping up to be a pretty normal (mind-numbingly boring) week. (Edit: Heading to cottage on Sunday, will NOT miss Saturday game day, thank god.)</i> </p1>

    <h1>Week Six:</h1>
    <p1><i>YO D&D CLUB AIN'T SHIT!!</i> </p1>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h1>Week Seven:</h1>
    <p1><i>It's friday boyss. I am fairly happy despite having a really shitty week. I forget what I did this week, aside from unit 2 in CMU, which I've already finished. Now I have a dilemma in that I've finished all the work but now I have nothing to do. Today we're doing a bit of work on the website, then playing minecraft hopefully for the rest of class, provided everyone else doesn't screw it up again (Last time we tried to play minecraft in like week 3 or smth everyone was super loud and we stopped becuase Mr J was pissed). Ideally everyone is quiet this time, and spawn doesn't become a giant clusterfuck of everyone screaming and punching each other. Thank god I spawned first last time and got some distance between me and everyone else. I'm going to try and get a bed down as fast as possible and get as far from world spawn as possible. I'm not really going to make alliances or fight people. I'll probably just find a nice bit of land (Either well hidden or just absurdly far from spawn) where everyone will either not find me or leave me alone, and sit there build Game of Thrones castles and stuff. I can probably get full diamond fairly fast compared to everyone else, I would think I'm a better player than most everyone else on the server. Also for some reason on Thursday we did tech Tuesday, after skipping it on Tuesday. Man really got my hopes up like that. On the bright side, he reduced the number of word to 250 instead of 500, and if you're writing it without a partner (I am, obviously) you only have to write like 150 or something around that. Better than 500 words to be sure. I had a shitty week due to a few things, which I will list. First and probably foremost, we had a field trip in history on Wednesday, which wasn't that bad if a little boring. The problem is that becuase of the trip I missed a math test which I had to do a make up for on the next day, which is the same day I got my unit 2 test (I got like a 67% or something awful like that), and I also had to do a history test (It was easy, but after bombing the unit 1+2 test and finding out I'd also bombed the unit 2 test, I was just about ready to jump off the roof). In summary, shitty, shitty, god-awful week, but it's over now. Tomorrow cannot come fast enough.</i> </p1>

    <h1>Week Eight:</h1>
    <p1><i>Pretty boring week, so nothing new or suprising. I got back my unit 1+2 test for math on Wednesday. Just under 50%, so quite poor. I don't think I'm below a 60% in that course so far, but I'm sure as hell not too far off. I don't know if the minimum passing grade is a 50% or a 60% but I need to step my marks the hell up if I'm going to go anywhere post-secondary. I'm going to just not tell anyone about that whole thing for as long as I can, squeeze out maybe a few more weekends. I know sure as hell if my parents see that they'll do their absolute best to make my life a living hell after all the other shitty marks I've shown them so far. Saturdays and Sundays are about all I have to look forward to at this point, and if those go away my life is going to get a whole lot worse. It's supposed to be motivation for me to try harder in math, but I'm already trying as hard as I can, so it's really just an incentive for me to sneak around and lie through my teeth to keep my marks from them. I think I understand the concepts of unit 3 quite well so far though, so maybe if I can delay them seeing the unit 1+2 test until I've smoothed things over with some better marks from this new unit. That should at least soften the blow, if not completely mitigate it. Even if it all goes to shit and I fail math, I only have to live with my parents for another 2.5 years or so, and there's always the military. On a brighter note, there is no brighter note, everything just sucks right now. In other words, everything I expected. On another dark, though admittedly less dire note, only 4 more days. If you know what that means, great, if you don't, you aren't meant to. Actually, there is a very small bright side, in that it is a Friday. Even if it's probably my last time, I reckon it'll still be a passably acceptable compensation for another (eighth) shitty week, in a month of shitty weeks.</i></p1>

    <h1>Week Nine:</h1>
    <p1><i>Either they didn't fully hear about it or they didn't care as much as I thought they would. They kind of just gave me a slap on the wrist with some tiny punishment. I don't remember what it was and I don't think they do either, so it's fine. I can probably just procede as normal and pretend it never happened, though this kind of luck never lasts long for me. Nothing much happened this week, as usual. Boring as hell and utterly pointless, learning absolutely nothing I'll ever need when I move out. I don't understand how knowing about parabolas and quadratic relations is going to help me pay bills and put food on the table, but whatever. I've been alive long enough to know that no one cares about anyone elses opinion. On the whole, much better mood than last week, though it is admittedly an almost laughably low bar. Last week was awful. Feeling fine now though, all (most) things considered. The trick is to not think about the other things. Not a whole lot to write about, considering nothing 
much happened. It's a nice problem to have, much better than something happening, since when something happens to me it's almost never a good thing. Going to get a haircut next week, it's about time in all honesty, getting annoying to clean and work around. That's about it though. It was an okay week, compared to previous weeks.</i></p1>

    <h1>Week Ten:</h1>
    <p1><i>Another awful week, Another quiz bombed. I'm writing this on Wednesday since tommorow is the remembrance day ceremony and Friday is a pd day. The weekend was almost awful, turns out my mom cared more than I thought, and just about stopped me from getting on my computer, cutting me off for another week. Luckily for me I was able to reason with her.</i></p1>

    <h1>Week Eleven:</h1>
    <p1><i>Welp, there's another test absolutely flunked. At this point I don't care anymore to be honest. I know I'm not going to college, no matter what my mother tries to tell me or force me to do. As long as I don't fail the course and have to take it again I don't at all care. New orders came in as far as my chromebook usage is concerned. I am now only allowed to use it before supper in my room, and I then have to use it downstairs. Not too much of an issue, as usual. These kinds of things follow a predictable cycle. She thinks I'm not spending enough time with her and the rest of the family, and takes away something in an attempt to get me out of my room and make me more social. Eventually she realizes that I'm still spending the same amount of time in my room, still don't eat any more or less, and still avoid her. Then she gives up and gives whatever she took back (usually). This should only lasta few weeks at most. As far as school goes, I'm still doing terribly, and I still hate it. Nothing new in that sector. Thursday was a shorter day though, because of some 7/8 thing, so that was fun. Anyway, today will be an easy day, and tommorow is Saturday.</i></p1>

    <h1>Week Twelve (Eighteen??):</h1>
    <p1><i>It's not Friday, but who cares at this point. I MAY have POSSIBLY missed a few (like six) weekly journal things. It's monday on the last week, Mr J isn't here so we're doing the rst tomorrow instead of today, meaning I'll be doing 2 rsts tomorrow. Thanks Mr J! Much thanks. Anyway, who cares. No matter how horrid this week is, no matter how miserable and awful, it's the last bloody week. Then it's all over, no more math until next year. Who cares what I have next semester, nothing could be as bad as quadratics and trig, so I figure next semester will be absurdly easy in comparison to this one. I don't know how well I'll do on my exams, but I don't really care. My mother can't do much more to me at this point. I don't care about my grades, and I couldn't care less if she does. I only have to pretend to care for another two and a half years or so. Then I'm out of here. I have no idea how I'll do in any of my other classes, though I know I'll do terrible in math. In any case, the end is in sight, can NOT wait for Friday.</i></p1>
